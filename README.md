CrimeGPT is a term commonly used to describe a class of AI-powered language models that are designed or misused for facilitating criminal or unethical activities. Unlike legitimate AI systems that follow strict safety and compliance controls, CrimeGPT-style models are typically characterized by the removal of safeguards, allowing unrestricted responses to sensitive or illegal prompts.

These systems are often discussed in the context of cybersecurity threats, as they may be leveraged for activities such as social engineering, phishing content generation, fraud scripting, or other forms of digital exploitation. Because of this, CrimeGPT is frequently cited by security researchers, law enforcement agencies, and policymakers as an example of how artificial intelligence can be weaponized when deployed without ethical oversight.

It is important to note that CrimeGPT is not a single official product, but rather a conceptual label used to describe malicious or unregulated AI implementations. Discussions around CrimeGPT primarily focus on the risks of misuse, the importance of AI governance, and the need for robust safeguards to ensure responsible deployment of advanced language models.
